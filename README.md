# Allophoneme

Machine Learning Model to find Allophones and Phonemes

## Purpose

This project is intended to help linguist find Allophones and Phonemes easier.
So far I've seen that linguists are strugglin to find Allophone and Phonemes manually
hence I tried to make their work easier by creating this app.

## Allophones and Phonemes

Allophones and phonemes are important concepts in the field of linguistics and the study of language. They are used to understand the sounds that are used in spoken language, and how these sounds can vary depending on the context and the speaker.

Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that can distinguish one word from another. For example, in English, the sounds /p/ and /b/ are phonemes, as they can change the meaning of a word (e.g. "pat" vs. "bat"). By identifying the phonemes in a language, linguists can better understand the sound system and structure of the language.

Allophones, on the other hand, are variations of phonemes that are used in different contexts. For example, the /p/ sound in English can be pronounced slightly differently depending on where it appears in a word or sentence. These different pronunciations are called allophones. By identifying allophones, linguists can better understand how language is used in different contexts and how sounds can vary based on the speaker or the environment.

Overall, understanding the concepts of phonemes and allophones is important for analyzing and understanding the sound systems of languages, as well as for developing and teaching language-related technologies such as speech recognition and synthesis.

## Installation
It's pretty simple
- $ `git clone https://github.com/stanley355/allophoneme.git`
- $ `cargo build`
- $ `cargo run`
